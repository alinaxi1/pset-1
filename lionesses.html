  <h1>Lionesses</h1>
	<br>
  <p>Female lions are called lionesses. In a pride, the lionesses
	are the ones who provide the food. <a href="malelions.html">Male lions</a>
	will occassionally hunt, but their main role is patrolling. In
 	addition to hunting, lionesses also raise the <a href= "cubs.html">cubs</a>.
	In a pride, most of the members are lionesses. They are all most likely
	related and interchangably nurse the cubs.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Lionesses are nocturnal and mainly hunt at night. They have extraordinary
	night vision and work as a team to bring down their large prey. The lead
	lioness will use tail signals to communicate with others in the pride. This
	is what the brown tufts of fur at the ends of the lionesses' tails are for.
	When they have sighted their prey, they spread out so they can surrond the
	target. The lead lioness begins the charge and chases the prey into the trap.
	Despite these advanced hunting tactics, only 10% of hunting attempts succeed.</p>
